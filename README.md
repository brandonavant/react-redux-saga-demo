# react-redux-saga-demo

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a React application which utilizes the following:

- React-Redux for State Management.
- Redux-Saga for asynchronous dispatching of actions out to an API.

The application consists of both a front-end (React) and and a back-end API (Node/Express). This setup is put in place to facilitate having an easy-to-access API with which the React-Saga piece can be used.

## Running Locally

When running the application locally, use the command `npm run dev` to start up both the front-end and back-end.
